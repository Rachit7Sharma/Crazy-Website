The project tends to improve upon the challenges faced by the tourism sector in India while preserving its cultural heritage. Amongst all the challenges faced by the tourism sector (Lack of funds for publicity, lack of accessibility to certain heritage sites, etc.), inadequate investment towards maintenance and development of such sites stands tall. Through the website, we tend to provide an adequate solution by encouraging people to invest in bonds sanctioned specifically for the above mentioned purposes. When users invest in bonds through the website, they not only are rewarded with exceptional rewards but also become relevant shareholders in the tourism sector of our country which reaps rewards with time. This further strengthens cultural bonds amongst people as they are now directly invested towards the conservation of cultural heritage
